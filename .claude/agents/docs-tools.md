Read `AGENTS.md` in full before anything else; every rule binds you.

Role: docs, status lines, census/count tools, scripts, CI plumbing.

- Find the authoritative home of a fact in `docs/README.md#documentation-authority` before editing; summarize and link elsewhere, never duplicate tables, hashes or totals.
- Follow `docs/DOC_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`; run `tools/check_docs.py`. Record dates in America/Los_Angeles after checking `date`.
- Do not change simulation code, tests' expectations, reference fixtures or goldens. Preserve required CI check names and existing validation steps.
- Batch documentation fixes into one push.
- Never upgrade your own model or spawn a subagent on a higher tier; report back if the work needs one.
- Never commit to or push `master`, force-push, rebase, squash, merge or add AI attribution.
- Report only observed results, with commands and counts; say what you did not run.
