# Standing engineering instructions

## Scope and source authority

- Work only within this repository and explicitly authorized resources. Do not
  access unrelated private repositories, proprietary assets, private cloud
  storage, credentials or confidential files. Public tests use synthetic or
  legally redistributable fixtures; commercial IWADs never enter Git, CI or logs.
- Preserve all 165 original upstream files, original history, attribution,
  `README.TXT` and `LICENSE.TXT`. Keep the repository public and GPL-2.0-only.
  Never import GPLv3-only implementation code.
- Original id Software Linux DOOM 1.10 at
  `a77dfb96cb91780ca334d0d4cfd86957558007e0` is behavioral authority. Read the
  relevant source investigation before changing an admitted behavior. Metadata
  recognition, executable admission and full compatibility are distinct claims.

## Architecture and determinism

- Prefer idiomatic safe Rust and explicit ownership. Workspace lints forbid
  unsafe code; exceptions require a separately reviewed policy and safety proof.
- Preserve 35 logical tics/second, fixed-point/integer semantics, original RNG
  ordering and deterministic actor/thinker/spatial order. No gameplay-critical
  unordered iteration, floating-point substitution or wall-clock dependency.
- Keep simulation separate from parsing, I/O, audio and future rendering.
  Presentation reads must not consume gameplay RNG or change outcomes.
- Validate offsets, sizes, counts, arithmetic, actor roles and generational
  references. Never sort handles to select blockers or rebuild source BLOCKMAP.
- Recoverable simulation errors preserve complete canonical state. Preflight
  bounded work before mutation; no full-simulation clone per tic. General user
  thinker budgets retain their separately documented nontransactional contract.
- Reuse actor storage, geometry, state entry, shared damage and lifecycle services.
  Unsupported actions must reject explicitly; callbacks must never silently no-op.
- Keep every historical profile, canonical schema and fixture expectation unchanged.
  New behavior requires an explicit configuration/schema choice. Preserve actor roles and
  existing admission/resource bounds; see [compatibility](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).
  Source-compatible original state entry is immediate; raw spawn has no action.

## Validation

- Run build, format (including fuzz workspace), Clippy with warnings denied,
  workspace tests, release simulation/type tests and warnings-denied rustdoc.
  Verify Rust 1.85.0 and exact-head Linux, Windows, native macOS and MSRV CI.
  Preserve `macos-26-intel`, required check names and existing validation steps.
- Run every original-C generator and independent DSIM encoder with `--check`,
  all historical/new asserted examples in debug/release, all fuzz builds and a
  bounded relevant sanitizer campaign. Commands are in [testing](docs/TESTING.md).
- Expected C traces come from genuine source bodies and declared adapters;
  canonical expectations come from independent encoders, never Rust output.
  Preserve historical fixtures, helper bytes, provenance and qualified evidence.
- Distinguish source equivalence, explicit fixture projection, independent DSIM
  consistency and Rust-only safety tests. Report actual counts, sanitizer options,
  findings and limitations. Disabled leak detection is not LeakSanitizer coverage.

## Branches, review and documentation

- Inspect status, master and open PRs first. Implement on focused feature branches,
  never directly on master; preserve unrelated changes and shared history.
- Merges require every applicable fresh local/exact-head gate; after the owner merges,
  verify post-merge CI when required.
- Open/update a focused PR with behavior, evidence, restrictions and unresolved
  issues. Do not claim unobserved passes.
- Maintain human-readable README, architecture, compatibility, roadmap, testing,
  source investigation and schema documentation. Use the
  [documentation review checklist](docs/DOC_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md). Archive historical
  evidence with digests and working links instead of deleting or rewriting it.
- Documentation is an equal engineering gate alongside source and tests. A milestone
  is not ready when its guides are stale, contradictory, incomplete, misleading
  or difficult for humans to understand; resolving links alone is insufficient.
- **Documentation authority:** Each information category has one authoritative
  home, mapped in the [documentation index](docs/README.md#documentation-authority).
  Milestone status belongs in ROADMAP, support/limits in COMPATIBILITY, schemas in
  STATE_FORMAT, commands in TESTING, observations in milestone evidence records,
  and exact review commits/CI/history in GitHub. Other pages summarize briefly and
  link; never maintain duplicate status tables, hashes, test totals or logs.
  Before editing, identify the authoritative home and check existing information
  there rather than creating another copy because a milestone changed.
- README describes current state only; a milestone adds or edits one row of the
  capability table and never appends prose history (history lives in
  [COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) and [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)).
- Keep the prominent machine-maintained/human-directed disclosure accurate. Do not
  imply universal manual review, absent human oversight or guaranteed correctness.
- Stop at the assigned milestone's owner-review gate; no unrelated systems.

## Session conventions

- Commit identity comes from the repo-local git config set by the owner (a GitHub
  noreply address, no personal name or email). Never add `Co-Authored-By` trailers,
  "Generated with" lines or any AI attribution to commits, PR titles or PR bodies.
- Never commit to or push `master`. Never force-push, rebase or squash shared history,
  delete branches or enable auto-merge. Never merge a PR; merging is the owner's call.
- Open one focused PR per milestone, draft until every gate passes; mark it ready only
  after the gates, then leave it unmerged.
- Run every performance measurement alone on an idle machine (no concurrent builds,
  tests or fuzzing) and say so in the record.
- Keep scratch builds, baseline checkouts and fuzz corpora outside the working tree;
  delete them at the end of a milestone after their results are recorded.
- Report only observed results; distinguish target compiled, seed replay, coverage-guided
  campaign and sanitizer campaign, and disclose disabled leak detection.
- Push the branch to origin after every completed plan step (no PR until gates pass).
- Check free disk space before large builds, baseline worktrees or fuzzing; keep at least
  20 GB free; clean scratch first or stop and report. Under WSL, `df ~` reports the
  virtual disk's ceiling, not real space: the real limit is the Windows drive that
  hosts it. Check `df -h /mnt/c` and keep at least 20 GB free there at all times.
