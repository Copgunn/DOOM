//! Per-map bounds of the Episode 1 policy (`PlayerMonstersEpisode1V1`, M4a
//! decision H4).
//!
//! Every older map policy fixed its roster, pickup, decoration and barrel bounds
//! as constants and proved from them that the actor store never fills. Episode 1
//! maps hold 41 to 118 monsters, so wire 23 derives each bound once at load from
//! the map's own THINGS lump, counted with the filter `P_SpawnMapThing` applies
//! in single player at the medium skill (p_mobj.c:708–797: player and deathmatch
//! starts are not spawned as things; `MTF_NOTSINGLE` (16) is skipped; the medium
//! skill bit (2) is required), and classified by DoomEd number. A spawn site that
//! finds the 1,024-slot store full refuses the tic with `StoreError::Capacity`
//! instead (the store-full witness). The bounds are immutable, never canonical
//! state, and the DSIM39 reader derives the same values from `map.things`
//! (`Episode1Bounds::from_thing_records`).
