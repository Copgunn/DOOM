# Compatibility boundaries

The behavioral authority is original id Software Linux DOOM 1.10. This is an early
headless rewrite supporting specific, limited behavior, not a complete source port.
This describes the code in this checkout, not its merge/review status. This
document owns support restrictions and limits; [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) owns
development status and plans. The [glossary](README.md#short-glossary) explains
profile, admission and fixture terminology.
Linux 1.10 comparisons do not prove DOS 1.9 demo synchronization.

## What a compatibility claim means

| Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Recognition | An original type, state or resource is represented as metadata |
| Validated parsing | Input records and references pass structural/safety checks |
| Supported execution | An explicitly selected configuration accepts specified actors and reachable actions |
| Original-C evidence | Specific inputs match genuine source bodies under declared adapters |
| Full-game compatibility | All enabled dependencies compose in the original game context; not established |

Loading a WAD, recognizing MT_SERGEANT or matching an isolated hash does not
establish the last level. [Reference notes](README.md) describe each admitted
slice and the [validation guide](VALIDATION.md) distinguishes evidence families.

## Versioned gameplay profiles

Historical profile behavior and DSIM bytes remain frozen. New behavior is opt-in.

| Configuration (profile) | Supported foundation |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Non-solid fixed-point headless movement and command foundations |
| 2 | Grounded player XY sliding and solid collision |
| 3 | Static multi-sector BSP/openings, XY/Z and gravity/dropoff |
| 4 | Explicit type/state lifecycle and bounded synthetic probes |
| 5 | Unbound damage, aim and hitscan |
| 6 | Bounded player weapons and psprites; complete player damage excluded |
| 7 | Bounded original plasma projectile foundations |
| 8 | Sight, ordered player scanning, sound propagation and Look |
| 9 | Non-attacking source pursuit |
| 10–12 | Separately admitted attack-selection, shotgunner and chaingunner fixtures |
| 13 | Demon melee with simplified fixture stand/run loops |
| 14 | Demon pain, ordinary death and persistent corpse lifecycle |
| 15 | Original two-state stand and eight-state run closure |
| 16 | Bounded classic Demon THING spawning, retaining the prior fixture flags |
| 17 | Map kill totals, original COUNTKILL flags and bounded death-credit context |
| 18 | Expanded bounded static geometry, unbound XY/Z and read-only original sight |

These are separate contracts, not modes that automatically admit all original
actors or map features. Detailed older limits remain available in the complete
[historical compatibility document](validation/archive/pre-m3d3j-compatibility.md).

## Demon support: remaining dependencies

| Dependency | Map-context configuration (profile 17) support |
| --- | --- |
| Source metadata | Original `MT_SERGEANT` type 12 / editor type 3002 is recognized unchanged |
| Map THING admission | Commercial single-player, normal timing, bounded Demon-only execution |
| Spawn compatibility | Signed fixed coordinates, BSP floor, quantized angle, raw state, original RNG/order |
| Original flags | SOLID/SHOOTABLE/COUNTKILL = 4194310 restored; ambush applied from THING |
| Level statistics | Kills/items/secrets reset to 0; admitted map COUNTKILL placements add available kills |
| Player statistics | Only genuine players[0].killcount fallback for absent/unbound sources; no player-pointer scoring |
| Damage/death | Existing shared services, pain chance 180, delayed sounds, ordinary death/Fall/quarter height |
| Terminal corpse | COUNTKILL retained; respawn disabled, no extra terminal RNG/movecount work |
| Respawn/raise | Explicitly unsupported; no Nightmare respawn or arch-vile resurrection |
| Complete original actor | Deferred: native type 136 identity, state aliases and disabled raise remain adaptations |

Only the old COUNTKILL flag projection is removed. Profile 17 uses
`ActorRegistry::demon_map_context_fixture`, not complete original actor admission.
Available `total_kills` never decreases on death/removal. The separate
`single_player_kill_count` represents source's unbound single-player fallback,
including absent sources, self damage and admitted monster-caused lethal damage.
It is not points, frags or a complete player/intermission subsystem. Other level
totals remain zero because items and sector specials are excluded.

Fresh restart resets the bounded level/actors/statistics while continuing RNG.
It returns a new simulation and does not perform complete game/input/player reload.
No API promises globally unique handles across separate simulation instances.

## Map size and processing limits

A valid parsed map may still be rejected by a simulation configuration. The bounds
below come from the linked implementation, not a promise of real-map gameplay or
unlimited geometry. Four different kinds of limits must be considered separately.

### 1. Original encoding and source semantics

The classic records have fixed-width fields. [Map types](../crates/doom-map/src/types.rs)
preserve signed 16-bit coordinates/heights, unsigned flag bit patterns and
16-bit references. The [parser](../crates/doom-map/src/parse.rs) additionally
validates references according to the selected Linux 1.10 interpretation:

- Ordinary vertex, line, sidedef and sector references must address existing
  records and fit the nonnegative signed 16-bit range. A Rust `u16` storage type
  does not automatically authorize larger source indexes.
- Node children use the high bit to mark a subsector and the lower bits for its
  index. Sidedef `0xffff` means absent; subsector first-seg/count fields have
  signed-range and contiguous-range checks.
- BLOCKMAP dimensions must be positive signed 16-bit values; referenced list
  offsets and line indexes follow signed source constraints. `0xffff` terminates
  a list. These rules can reject data well below allocation budgets.

Changing a budget cannot widen an on-disk field or remove a reserved marker.
Supporting another source interpretation or an extended map format requires an
explicit compatibility decision and, where needed, different representations.

### 2. Parser safety budgets

[MapLimits and Budget](../crates/doom-map/src/parse.rs) provide these defaults:

| Setting | Default | What it bounds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_records` | 32,768 | Decoded records per table |
| `max_lump_bytes` | 64 MiB | Bytes in one map lump |
| `max_blockmap_cells` | 262,144 | Decoded collision-grid cells |
| `max_blockmap_words` | 4 Mi words | Raw BLOCKMAP header/table/list storage |
| `max_decoded_bytes` | 128 MiB | Cumulative requested decoded and scratch allocation |

These are resource ceilings, not guaranteed supported map sizes. Checked
multiplication/addition and fallible reservations enforce the allocation budget.
The parser also hard-caps every record table at 32,768 independently of the
configurable setting. Its uniform application needs table-by-table investigation:
for example, the THINGS record count comes from lump length, not a 16-bit count
field. Neither that policy nor every classic reference is interchangeable with a
universal format limit. Increasing `max_records` alone does not remove the cap.

### 3. Temporary simulation support restrictions

These narrower bounds support the existing arithmetic, ownership and preflight
proofs. They are not classic-map format limits; changing one requires checking
all dependent representations and services.

| Area | Current bound | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Historical collision profiles 2–17 | 128 lines; 4,096 BLOCKMAP cells; 65,536 BLOCKMAP words | [prepare_cells](../crates/doom-sim/src/movement.rs) |
| Historical topology profiles 3–17 | 128 sectors; 4,096 subsectors; 4,096 nodes | [Topology::new](../crates/doom-sim/src/multisector.rs) |
| Historical sight-supported geometry through profile18 | Absolute vertex coordinates, node origins/deltas and sector heights at most 512 map units | [validate_map](../crates/doom-sim/src/sight.rs) |
| Map Demon setup | 256 THINGS, four native Demon test actors, 64 total actor slots | [map spawning](../crates/doom-sim/src/demon_map_spawn.rs), [constructor](../crates/doom-sim/src/demon_lifecycle.rs) |
| Earlier general actor-state setup | 4,096 THINGS and 1,024 actor slots | [actor-state constructor](../crates/doom-sim/src/spawning.rs) |
| Underlying actor store | Configurable, at most 65,536 slots; individual configurations are stricter | [ThinkerStore::new](../crates/doom-sim/src/store.rs) |
| Map Demon arithmetic margins | Absolute spawn coordinates 978, owner query margin 1,008, other actor coordinates 994, general actor/query range 1,024 map units; body initial XY momentum and admitted Z momentum at most 64 units | [map preflight](../crates/doom-sim/src/demon_map_spawn.rs), [spawn checks](../crates/doom-sim/src/spawning.rs), [sight](../crates/doom-sim/src/sight.rs) |

For example, collision and hitscan services contain fixed line-work buffers tied
to the line bound; raising only the rejection constant would not be sufficient.
The [future map-scale milestone](ROADMAP.md#map-scale-limits-and-real-map-readiness)
describes the broader direction. The separate geometry configurations below
expand their declared slices while retaining historical admission.

### 4. Performance and traversal work limits

| Service | Current work bound | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Historical sight through profile18 | 8,192 units of fully expanded BSP traversal work, including repeated children/segs | [sight work validation](../crates/doom-sim/src/sight.rs) |
| Hitscan | 64 grid-cell iterations; candidate count bounded by `64 * (128 + 1024)` | [combat tracing](../crates/doom-sim/src/combat_trace.rs) |
| State actions | 128 immediate entry work units, 8,192 planned step work units, and bounded child spawning | [lifecycle planning](../crates/doom-sim/src/lifecycle.rs) |

Some work bounds also preserve source semantics: the hitscan cell loop follows
[original P_PathTraverse](../linuxdoom-1.10/p_maputl.c), so expanding it may change
vanilla behavior. Other bounds prevent pathological CPU/memory growth. The future
inventory must distinguish these reasons rather than replace every value with a
large constant. Keep deterministic traversal and checked resource use throughout.

## Map-scale profile

`Simulation::map_scale` / `with_map_scale_limits` select profile18, not a Demon or
player profile. Parsing capacities/formats are unchanged. The new configuration
supports at most **1,024 linedefs, 256 static sectors, 64 unbound actor slots,
4,096 BLOCKMAP cells, 65,536 raw BLOCKMAP words, and 262,144 compiled first-occurrence
references summed over cells**. Shared lists count once per cell in the last budget.
Nodes and subsectors remain at most 4,096 each. Smaller actor/reference budgets
are available through `MapScaleLimits`; higher budgets reject.

Vertex coordinates, node origins/deltas, sector heights and BLOCKMAP origins stay within
512 absolute map units. Original sight expansion remains bounded at 8,192 work
units, including repeated node children and segs. Spawn positions/absolute Z and
current positions/Z before a step stay within 994 units; XY/Z momentum is at most
64. Source XY movement clamps to 30. Read-only destination/sight actor coordinates
are bounded at 1,024 units. A source step can leave the 994-unit step-admission
margin; the next step then rejects atomically. This is an explicit conservative
Rust boundary, not unrestricted off-map movement compatibility.

Use parameterized unbound bodies and existing XY/Z, gravity, openings, collision,
sector/BLOCKMAP head insertion and thinker storage. THINGS remain parsed data.
Read-only `check_sight` preserves REJECT indexing and source BSP/seg ordering without
admitting perception rosters or AI. Unsupported player binding, typed spawning,
map spawning, damage/hitscan, noise/Look/Chase, map specials and dynamic sectors
reject; no unsupported callback becomes a no-op. Real player, Demon/Spectre and
whole-map/game admission are not implied.

Source BLOCKMAP words, cell traversal and first encounters determine candidates.
Lists are never rebuilt or globally sorted by line ID. Recoverable rejected setup,
controls, identity queries and stepping preserve canonical state. Allocation for
new geometry preparation is fallible and bounded; existing runtime diagnostic
allocation exhaustion retains the process-level Rust policy described by `step`.
The source 64-cell slide/hitscan traversal and 128-intercept restriction are not
expanded or admitted by this configuration. Historical constructors retain their
old capacities and DSIM expectations.

[Source findings](M3F1_REFERENCE.md) explain the representation and adapter;
[measured evidence](validation/M3F1.md) separates original-C equivalence,
independent DSIM consistency, safety tests and host measurements. This supports
larger controlled classic fixtures, not all real DOOM maps or vanilla demos.

## Map-extent profile

`Simulation::map_extent` / `with_map_extent_limits` select **profile19**, a separate
unbound static-geometry configuration. Historical profiles, including profile18,
retain their existing coordinate/work rejection thresholds and canonical bytes.
Classic formats and parser budgets are unchanged.

| Domain or resource | Profile19 admission |
| --- | --- |
| Vertex components, node origins and node deltas | Absolute 2,048 map units each |
| Linedef delta | `abs(dx) + abs(dy) <= 1,536` units, checked from endpoints |
| Sector floor/ceiling | Absolute 1,024 units; noninverted |
| BLOCKMAP origin components | Absolute 2,048 units |
| Actor spawn/current XY before a tic | Absolute 2,018 units |
| Destination and sight XY | Absolute 2,048 units |
| Absolute spawn/current Z before a tic | Absolute 1,984 units; floor/ceiling placement uses the sector |
| Sight Z | Absolute 2,048 units |
| Actor radius / height | Radius 0–32; positive height fitting the spawn sector, at most 2,048 |
| XY/Z momentum | Absolute 64; original XY clamp remains 30 |
| Linedefs / sectors / unbound actor slots | 1,024 / 256 / 64 |
| Nodes / subsectors | 4,096 each |
| BLOCKMAP cells / raw words | 8,192 / 65,536 |
| Prepared first-occurrence references | 262,144, counting each shared list once per cell |
| Conservative preparation allocation requests | 4 MiB; independently configurable downward |
| Collision work proof | At most 16,384 units; setup checks `nodes + 4*lines + 4*actor_limit` |
| Expanded sight work | 16,384, counting both repeated children, leaves and segs |

`MapExtentLimits` allows smaller actor, reference, preparation-memory and collision-
work budgets. Larger budgets reject. Preparation charges reserved reference limits
and native-size cell/line/membership/topology/work scratch conservatively, including
scratch whose lifetimes do not overlap. Parsed Map storage, canonical caches,
actors, snapshots and allocator overhead are outside that request budget and retain
their separately bounded/process-level allocation policies. Geometry preparation
and new sight-query scratch reservations are fallible. Existing tic diagnostics
and canonical allocation exhaustion remain process-level Rust failures, not `SimError`.

World-space bounds and pairwise differences are distinct: admitted query actors
can differ by 4,096 units. The line-delta norm additionally protects the original
shifted intercept sum/difference; blindly enlarging all coordinates would not.
This is not a strict superset of profile18: some long old diagonals require the
old narrower interaction domain. A successful tic can leave the next-tic XY/Z or
momentum margin; a subsequent tic rejects before any earlier actor moves.

A radius-bounded destination visits at most four line cells and four thing cells:
at most 4,096 compiled references, 1,024 unique linedef callbacks and 64 unique
thing candidates. BSP lookup adds at most the admitted node count. Source supplied
list/cell order, duplicate suppression, leading-zero behavior, things-before-lines,
head insertion and thinker order remain authoritative. Conventional empty cells
still contain the required zero word and therefore visit line0. Unused grid padding
need not fit world coordinates; runtime queries cannot leave their proven domain.

Coordinate bounds are necessary, but not sufficient for every source sight input.
Quantized side tests can produce an intercept saturated to `INT_MIN`; original
FixedDiv would then evaluate undefined `abs(INT_MIN)` during clipping. Profile19
returns a recoverable arithmetic error before that division, preserving canonical
state. Historical profiles retain their existing explicit Rust numeric policy.

Sight caches a proved full-root expansion cost; query execution uses that same
bound and fallibly reserves bounded tasks/observations. REJECT returns before BSP
work or scratch reservation. No query consumes RNG or changes canonical state.

Use existing unbound XY/Z, gravity, static openings, spatial storage and read-only
sight only. Player binding, typed actors, map spawning, AI/hearing, combat/hitscan,
sliding, dynamic sectors, specials and complete game/map admission remain excluded.
Original 64-cell `P_PathTraverse` and 128-intercept behavior is unchanged.
[Source analysis](M3F2_REFERENCE.md) owns the arithmetic derivation;
[observations](validation/M3F2.md) distinguish genuine C comparisons, independent
canonical encoding, Rust safety tests and host measurements.

## Demon runtime restrictions

Map-spawned Demon thinkers precede stable unbound type 135 test targets/effects.
Live Demon, perception-roster and sound targets must use that target role. Real
player bindings reject. Demon actors can enter only through the atomic map setup
batch, not ordinary in-tic spawning. Source identifiers/state aliases remain the
documented adaptation in the support matrix above. The [source investigation](M3D3I_REFERENCE.md)
explains its ownership proof. Capacity/work/checked-statistics overflow and stale
identities reject before changing canonical state.

Synthetic cross-native lethal or already-ignored damage is admitted because source
returns before retargeting. Nonlethal cross-native damage rejects; autonomous AI
still cannot acquire native targets. No generalized infighting or projectile
interaction is implied. Source/inflictor identity is validated even for ignored
requests as a Rust safety policy. Unsupported actions never silently no-op.

## Deferred systems

Full player damage/inventory/armor/powers/scoring, multiplayer, Fast/Nightmare
execution, respawning, resurrection, dynamic sectors, doors, specials, complete
map/actor spawning, generalized monster interactions, demos and presentation remain
unsupported. Spectre metadata recognition is not Spectre gameplay compatibility.
Source undefined behavior is not a compatibility target; checked Rust rejection
and adapter-defined evaluation order are recorded separately.

[STATE_FORMAT](STATE_FORMAT.md) for schemas, and [TESTING](TESTING.md) to reproduce.
