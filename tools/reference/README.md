# Original-C references and independent snapshots

The harnesses compile genuine bodies from the preserved Linux DOOM 1.10 source.
Synthetic adapters supply explicit geometry, actors and unsupported-service
boundaries; they do not constitute original whole-game execution. Compiled
function inventory is not branch coverage.

## Reproduce

From the repository root on a supported GNU C/Linux host:

```sh
python3 tools/reference/check_references.py
```

This checks all 17 generator/independent-encoder pairs without modifying fixtures.
To reproduce the map-context slice alone:

```sh
python3 tools/reference/generate_m3d3j.py --check
python3 tools/reference/m3d3j_snapshot_goldens.py --check
```

Generators read original C/public inputs, never Rust output. A deliberate fixture
regeneration omits `--check`; review the source, adapter and output differences
before accepting it. Preserve all historical generators, encoders, helper bytes
and fixtures. [Testing](../../docs/TESTING.md) lists Rust comparisons and examples.

## Evidence layout

- `generate.py` / `snapshot_goldens.py`: original foundations and DSIM-v1.
- `generate_<milestone>.py` / `<milestone>_snapshot_goldens.py`: subsequent source
  closures and independent DSIM-v2–v17 encoders.
- `tests/reference/`: synthetic maps, exact C rows, input tables, provenance,
  complete byte streams and per-tic digest indexes.
- `tests/support/`: Rust readers/adapters for those public inputs and observations.
- [Source investigations](../../docs/README.md): behavior, scope and safe differences.
- [State format](../../docs/STATE_FORMAT.md): fixed encodings and event chronology.

Provenance records source/body/adapter hashes, compiler flags, ABI assumptions and
output hashes. Signed shifts or unspecified evaluation order need explicit adapter
policies; they cannot silently become claims about all original C executions.
C source comparisons, fixture projection, independent encoding and Rust safety
policy tests are reported separately.

## M3d3j map context

The generator compiles 70 genuine bodies for the existing load/spawn/movement/
combat/thinker/RNG closure. Two original P_SetupLevel initialization fragments are
extracted verbatim and hashed separately; the complete level loader is not compiled
or claimed. Original structs/tables are used. Unsupported runtime callbacks abort.

A separate unadapted source-spawn pass retains type12, original states/flags and
map totals. The gameplay pass maps identity/state IDs to the explicit native136
fixture while retaining original COUNTKILL flags. C observes available kills,
unbound single-player fallback credit, corpse scheduling, source relationships,
reset and continuing RNG. Ten separate credit components include actual
player-pointer/network branches as source observations only; Rust does not admit
those subsystems. The existing 123 filter components distinguish admitted original
filters from recoverable Rust rejection policies.

The independent v17 encoder uses only C observations, source metadata, public
inputs and the documented schema. It supplies complete bytes and per-tic digests;
Rust comparisons identify the first differing field when full fixtures exist.
Head-of-list retirement belongs inside the thinker phase even when it precedes
the first live Think observation. This is covered by the corpse-removal fixture.
No commercial assets or network services are used.

provenance details remain in the complete
